This website is dedicated to providing the management protocols (to be) followed in Ain Shams University Women's Hospital. They are intended to serve as a quick reference for healthcare professionals working in our institute.

Please note that these protocols may not be exhaustive and should not replace clinical judgment. Always consider the individual patient's circumstances and consult relevant specialists when necessary.

## How protocols were developed

Each protocol was developed through a comprehensive review of current international guidelines, including those from NICE, RCOG, ACOG, SOGC, FIGO, and WHO. Relevant recommendations were then adapted to align with the our real-world capabilities, resources, and patient population.
