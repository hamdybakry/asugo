# Definitions & Classification

- **Chronic Hypertension:** Hypertension present at the booking visit, or before 20 weeks, or likely to be chronic.
- **Gestational Hypertension:** New hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without significant proteinuria.
- **Preeclampsia:** New hypertension after 20 weeks with significant proteinuria (PCR $\ge$ 30 mg/mmol) OR maternal organ dysfunction (renal, liver, neuro, haematological) OR uteroplacental dysfunction (fetal growth restriction).

# Risk Reduction (Aspirin)

Prescribe **Aspirin 75–150 mg daily** from 12 weeks until birth if:

- **1 High Risk Factor:** Hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, Chronic kidney disease, Autoimmune disease (SLE/APS), Type 1 or 2 diabetes, Chronic hypertension.
- **2 Moderate Risk Factors:** Nulliparity, Age $\ge$ 40 years, Pregnancy interval > 10 years, BMI $\ge$ 35 kg/m$^2$ at first visit, Family history of preeclampsia, Multifetal pregnancy.

# Chronic hypertension

- **Pre-conception / First Trimester:**
    - Stop ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and thiazide diuretics (risk of congenital abnormalities).
    - Substitute with **Labetalol** (1st line), **Nifedipine** modified-release (2nd line), or **Methyldopa** (3rd line).
    - Target BP: **135/85 mmHg**.
- **Management:**
    - Monitor BP weekly if poorly controlled, otherwise every 2–4 weeks.
    - Offer PLGF-based testing to rule out superimposed preeclampsia if suspected.
  - **Timing of Birth:** Offer planned birth at **37+0 weeks** (or earlier if indicated). Continue treatment during labour.

# Gestational hypertension

- **Assessment:**
    - Urine dipstick at every visit. If $\ge$ 1+, send for PCR/ACR.
    - Evaluate for symptoms of preeclampsia (headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, oedema).
- **Management:**
    - **BP 140/90 – 159/109 mmHg:**
        - Offer anti-hypertensives: (1) Labetalol, (2) Nifedipine, (3) Methyldopa.
        - Target BP: **135/85 mmHg**.
        - Monitor BP 1-2 times/week; Urine weekly.
    - **BP $\ge$ 160/110 mmHg (Severe):**
        - Admit. Start treatment immediately.
    - Target BP: **135/85 mmHg**.
    - Monitor BP 4 times/day minimum.
- **Timing of Birth:** Offer planned birth at **37+0 weeks**.

# Preeclampsia

- **Assessment:**
    - CBC, LFTs, Creatinine.
- **Management:**
    - **Mild/Moderate (140/90 - 159/109):** Admit usually not required if stable. Treat to target **135/85 mmHg**. Monitor BP 2x/week at least. Monitor fetal growth/dopplers (repeating every 2 weeks).
    - **Severe ($\ge$ 160/110):** Admission required.
        - **Antihypertensives:** Labetalol (oral/IV), Nifedipine, Hydralazine.
        - **Magnesium Sulfate:** Give if severe features (severe headache, clonus, visual disturbance) or eclamptic seizure. Regimen: 4g IV loading dose over 5-15 min, then 1g/hr infusion for 24h.
    - **Corticosteroids:** Offer if < 34 weeks.
- **Timing of Birth:**
    - **Normally:** Initiate birth at **37+0 weeks**.
    - **< 37 weeks:** expectant management unless maternal/fetal compromise (uncontrolled BP, HELLP, eclampsia, placental abruption, severe FGR).

# Postpartum management

- **Monitoring:**
    - Measure BP daily for first 2 days.
    - If pre-eclampsia: At least 4 times/day while inpatient.
- **Medication:**
    - **Methyldopa:** Stop within 2 days of birth (risk of depression).
    - **Labetalol / Nifedipine / Enalapril:** Safe for breastfeeding. Amlodipine is also an option.
    - Avoid diuretics if breastfeeding (may reduce milk supply).
- **Follow-up:**
    - Transfer to community care if BP < 150/100 mmHg.
    - GP review at 2 weeks (medical review) and 6-8 weeks (postnatal check).
- **Future Health:** Discuss long-term cardiovascular risks and lifestyle modifications.
