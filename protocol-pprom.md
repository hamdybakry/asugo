## Diagnosis

- History of watery vaginal discharge.
- Sterile speculum examination demonstrating liquor.
- The role of ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume is unclear.
- Digital vaginal exam should not be done unless in labor.
- 

## Investigations

- Maternal:
    - CBC, CRP
    - Urine analysis and culture
- Fetal:
    - CTG (if >28 weeks)
    - Ultrasound for growth and amniotic fluid volume

## Management

- Admission. Outpatient management only by consultant decision (individualized).
- Antibiotics:
    - Azithromycin 1 g PO single dose, plus
    - Penicillins (for 7 days):
        - Ampicillin-sulbactam 2 g IV q6h × 2 days, then
        - Amoxicillin 250 mg PO q8h × 5 days, plus
- Antenatal corticosteroids (dexamethasone) if <34/<36 weeks after screening for GDM:
    - Dose:
        - 6 mg IM q12h × 4 doses, or
        - 12 mg IM q24h × 2 doses
    - Repeat courses not routinely offeerred
- Magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection if <30/<34 weeks.

### Birth

- Timing:
    - <34 weeks: expectant management until 34 weeks, unless indicated earlier
    - 34-<36 weeks: consider delivery after corticosteroids (individualized)
    - 36-37 weeks: deliver
- Indications for earlier delivery:
    - Chorioamnionitis
    - Fetal distress
    - Associated medical indications (e.g., severe preeclampsia)
- Mode: VD unless CS is otherwise indicated.
- Neonatologists should be informed when delivery is anticipated.

## Special considerations

### Periviable ROM

- <20 weeks → counsel regarding poor prognosis; risk of pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal deformities, and neonatal death, in addition to risk of maternal morbidity from chorioamnionitis and sepsis.
- 20-<24 weeks → expectant management or termination of pregnancy after counseling. 
- 24 weeks → expectant management.

### Women with cerclage

- 

### Preterm labor

- Tocolysis is not recommended as it is associated with increased risk of chorioamnionitis.

### Chorioamnionitis

- A combination of clinical assessment, maternal blood tests (CRP and WBC) and FHR should be used to diagnose chorioamnionitis in women with PPROM; these parameters should not be used in isolation.
- Diagnosis: Maternal fever >38°C plus 2 of the following:
    - Maternal tachycardia >100 bpm
    - Fetal tachycardia >160 bpm
    - Uterine tenderness
    - Foul smelling vaginal discharge
    - Elevated WBC >15,000/mm^3^ (less reliable if corticosteroids given)
- Management:
    - Antibuotics:
    - Expedite delivery

## Postpartum/preconceptional advice

- Risk in subsequent pregnancies is increased.
