## Purpose

This website provides management protocols for clinical practice at Ain Shams University Women's Hospital. These protocols serve as evidence-based reference guides for healthcare professionals working within our institution.

## Development methodology

Each protocol was developed through a comprehensive review of available current international guidelines from NICE, RCOG, ACOG, SOGC, FIGO, and WHO. Evidence-based recommendations have been adapted to reflect our institution's resources, and our patient population characteristics.

## Disclaimer

These protocols are intended to support clinical decision-making but are not exhaustive and should not replace individual clinical judgment. Healthcare professionals must consider each patient's unique circumstances and consult relevant specialists when necessary.
