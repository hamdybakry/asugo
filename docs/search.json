Continue treatment during labour.\n\n\n\n\nGestational hypertension\n\nAssessment:\n\nUrine dipstick at every visit.

Monitor fetal growth/dopplers (repeating every 2 weeks).\nSevere (\\(\\ge\\) 160/110): Admission required.\n\nAntihypertensives: Labetalol (oral/IV), Nifedipine, Hydralazine.\nMagnesium Sulfate: Give if severe features (severe headache, clonus, visual disturbance) or eclamptic seizure. Regimen: 4g IV loading dose over 5-15 min, then 1g/hr infusion for 24h.\n\nCorticosteroids: Offer if &lt; 34 weeks.\n\nTiming of Birth:\n\nNormally: Initiate birth at 37+0 weeks.\n&lt; 37 weeks: expectant management unless maternal/fetal compromise (uncontrolled BP, HELLP, eclampsia, placental abruption, severe FGR).\n\n\n\n\nPostpartum management\n\nMonitoring:\n\nMeasure BP daily for first 2 days.\nIf pre-eclampsia: At least 4 times/day while inpatient.\n\nMedication:\n\nMethyldopa: Stop within 2 days of birth (risk of depression).\nLabetalol / Nifedipine / Enalapril: Safe for breastfeeding. Amlodipine is also an option.\nAvoid diuretics if breastfeeding (may reduce milk supply).\n\nFollow-up:\n\nTransfer to community care if BP &lt; 150/100 mmHg.\nGP review at 2 weeks (medical review) and 6-8 weeks (postnatal check).\n\nFuture Health: Discuss long-term cardiovascular risks and lifestyle modifications.",
